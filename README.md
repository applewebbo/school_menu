# Welcome to Mensa Scuola

Do you want to know what your kid is eating at school. Sick of searching trough a long excel file published on the school site or making complex operations to calculate what week are you in?

So do I... so I created this little project to automate the process. I'm working on it to let user authenticate, create a school and update the menu for their kids with a simple csv file. Stay tuned..

Feel free to use it for your kids

Made with **Django**, **Tailwind** and **Htmx**
