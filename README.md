# Welcome to Mensa Scuola

Do you want to know what your kid is eating at school. Sick of searching through a long excel file published on the school site or making complex operations to calculate what week are you in?

So do I... so I created this little project to automate the process. You can create an account, a school, upload the menu in csv format or add it manually via a form. You can have simple, detailed or annual meals. You can share the menu with other parents and get feedback on the menu. I'm now working on push notifications for getting a daily reminder of what your kid will it in the current day if you subscribe to the service. You can check the instructions on the site at this link https://menu.webbografico.com/help (only in italian, working on getting the site traslated in a future update). All the site is GPDR compliant and you can delete your account at any time.

Feel free to use it for your kids
