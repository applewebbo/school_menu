        setproctitle (pulled in transitively by granian[pname]) crashes with a
        segfault when called from a forked child on macOS: CoreFoundation's
        os_log preference lookup isn't fork-safe. django-q2's get_mp_context()
        picks "fork" whenever it's available, so hide it from
        get_all_start_methods() instead of patching django_q.cluster directly
        — every qcluster child re-runs django.setup() (and this hook) from a
        fresh interpreter while django_q.cluster is still mid-import, so
        patching that module here would race its own circular-import guard.
        multiprocessing has no such circularity.
