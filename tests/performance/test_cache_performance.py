"""
Cache performance tests for validating caching implementation

This module measures cache effectiveness by testing hit rates and response time
improvements. These tests validate that caching is working correctly and providing
the expected performance benefits.

NOTE: These tests should be run AFTER caching is implemented in the application.
Without caching, hit rates will be 0% and response times will not improve.

Expected results AFTER caching implementation:
- Cache hit rate: ≥99% for identical repeated requests
- Response time with cache: <50ms (10-50x faster than uncached)
- Cache invalidation: Updates reflected immediately after cache clear
